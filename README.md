## Installation
These steps will help you set up the project on your machine. They were written with UNIX/UNIX-like based systems in mind.

### With Docker
You'll need [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) to set up this project properly

Build the project:
```
docker-compose build
```

Run the project:
```
docker-compose up
```

### Without Docker
(Optional) Create virtual environment and activate it:
```
virtualenv venv && source venv/bin/activate
```
**Note**: If you're not using virtual environment make sure to use the proper version of [Python](https://www.python.org/)

Install requirements:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Database
These steps will help you prepare the demo data used in the app

Run migrations:
```
python project/manage.py migrate
```

Load data:
```
python project/manage.py loaddata project/fixtures.json
```

Run the project:
```
python project/manage.py runserver
```

## Tests and lint

### With Docker
```
docker-compose run web sh -c "cd project && python manage.py test && flake8"
```

**Note**: Using the above command will create a new docker container with each run. It can provide some memory issues when development process is still running and the software is often tested. You can clear them all after some time with:
```
./remove_test_containers.sh
```

### Without Docker
Make sure to be in the /project/ directory
```
python manage.py test && flake8
```
